# MNIST_Project_

This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. The model is trained using scipy.optimize for optimization and predicts digits drawn on a Tkinter-based GUI canvas. Users can draw a digit, and the trained model will recognize it with high accuracy. The project includes image preprocessing, neural network training, and a GUI for real-time predictions. Improvements such as better image scaling, color inversion, and CNN-based training can further enhance accuracy. ðŸš€
